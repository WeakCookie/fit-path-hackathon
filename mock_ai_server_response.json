                "reasoning": "Given the continued leg soreness and recent high-intensity long run, active recovery through non-impact exercise will reduce strain on the injured ankle while supporting blood flow and healing. Evidence-based reference specific to exercise modality is not provided, but modification is warranted due to injury and soreness.",

                "reasoning": "To promote recovery and reduce the risk of overuse or re-injury in the context of muscle soreness and previous ankle injury, a low-intensity session is appropriate. No explicit RPE adjustment evidence from research, but a reduction aligns with general injury management strategies.",

                "reasoning": "With no sleep deprivation reported, the standard session duration can be modulated for a lighter recovery workout. Selection of 1800 seconds (30 minutes) supports recovery without excessive load, though this is not directly specified in the referenced research.",

                "reasoning": "\"When sleep duration is less than 5 hours, extending rest periods to 2 minutes between sets allows full recovery of maximum strength for subsequent sets\". While user sleep is not specified as <5h, recommending extended rest aligns with optimal recovery support for muscle soreness and elevated injury risk.",

                "prediction": "Based on your recent high-intensity long run and the fact that your legs are still sore (especially on top of your ankle history), tomorrow should focus on 'Active Recovery' or a 'Cross Training' session—think gentle cycling, swimming, or a brisk walk. This lets you promote blood flow and healing without risking more impact on your recovering legs and ankle."

            {
                "type": "intensity",
                "prediction": "I recommend keeping the intensity very light, around an RPE of 3 out of 10. This ensures you're giving your body a chance to recover while still staying mobile and supporting your ongoing progress."

            {
                "type": "duration",
                "prediction": "An optimal duration for your recovery session tomorrow would be about 30 to 40 minutes (1800-2400 seconds). This is just enough to stimulate recovery without adding stress—remember, quality of movement is more important than duration right now."

            {
                "type": "rest_time",
                "prediction": "Since the focus is on continuous, low-impact movement, you won't need strict rest periods tomorrow. However, if you opt for circuit-style bodyweight mobility exercises, consider resting 60 seconds between movements if you start to feel fatigued or any ankle discomfort. Otherwise, take breaks as needed and prioritize how your body feels."
